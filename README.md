Software Security 

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a consulting company that offers personalized financial planning services to their clients. As part of their efforts to modernize their operations, they wanted to develop a custom web application to help them better manage their clients' financial data. The application needed to have strong security features to protect sensitive client information. Specifically, they requested a file verification step to ensure secure communications and a data verification step in the form of a checksum to be added to their web application.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
When conducting a vulnerability assessment of the client's software, I paid close attention to detail and conducted a thorough analysis of potential security risks. I also communicated effectively with the client to ensure that their concerns and needs were fully understood and addressed.

Coding securely is important because it helps to protect against potential security breaches that could result in the loss of sensitive data or financial information. Implementing strong security measures adds value to a company's overall well-being by building trust with clients and reducing the risk of reputational damage or legal liability.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
One of the most challenging aspects of the vulnerability assessment was identifying potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. However, this process was also helpful in improving my understanding of software security and the importance of implementing strong security measures.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
To increase the layers of security for the client's web application, I implemented a file verification step using digital signatures and a data verification step using checksums. In the future, I would use a variety of tools and techniques to assess vulnerabilities, such as code review, penetration testing, and threat modeling. I would also consider factors such as the potential impact of a vulnerability and the likelihood of an attack when deciding which mitigation techniques to use.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
To ensure that the code and software application were functional and secure, I conducted thorough testing and verification of all security features. After refactoring the code, I used automated testing tools and manual inspection to check for new vulnerabilities or weaknesses.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
In completing this assignment, I used a variety of resources and tools, including code analysis tools, digital signature libraries, and checksum algorithms. I also followed best practices for secure coding, such as input validation and output encoding. These resources and practices will be helpful in future assignments or tasks related to software security.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
From this assignment, I could show future employers my ability to conduct a thorough vulnerability assessment, develop secure coding protocols, and implement effective security features. I could also demonstrate my expertise in using digital signatures and checksums to ensure secure communications and data verification.
